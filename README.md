# Homework 1 - Code Refactor

# Description
This is my submitted work for Homework 1 - Code Refactor.  The assignment was to refactor the html and the css to 'leave it better than when I found it'.  There were several issues in the html such as no title, no alt elements in images, and no semantic tags (header, footer, aside, etc.).  The CSS needed to be changed to match the new semantic tags, and there were many items that were repeated that could be included in one chunk of code.
